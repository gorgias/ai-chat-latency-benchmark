// Standardized, THEMED conversation pools. The SAME set of themes runs on EVERY
// store (apple-to-apple). Each theme is an independent ~7-turn conversation; the
// runner runs each theme in its OWN fresh incognito context, so no two
// conversations (themes or modes) ever share session state.
//
// IMPORTANT: no turn asks for a human. Any handover the assistant initiates is
// unprompted, and the runner flags it (incl. "agent joined" / transfer / email
// gate). Success rate = % of turns answered with no handover.
//
// Catalog-agnostic phrasing so the same theme works on any storefront.
